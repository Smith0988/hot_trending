But Did You Document it?
If It's Too Loud You're Too Old
Living the High Life
This Is what awesome looks like
Stronger Than Yesterday
Not All Heroes Wear Capes. Some Wear Scrubs
I'm Not Yelling. I'm Projecting
Find a Way Not an Excuse
I am Fearfully and Wonderfully Made
You're Doing Great Bitch
for A Small Town IT Sure HAS A LOT of Assholes
I'm A Woman Phenomenally Phenomenal Woman That's Me 
do what scares you until it doesn't
DON'T DRIVE IF YOU DRINK
