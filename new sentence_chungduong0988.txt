I Hate People
Stand for The Flag Kneel for The Fallen
Not All Who Wander are Lost
My Spirit Animal is Bigfoot
Objects in Mirror are Losing
And Into The Forest I Go To Lose My Mind And Find My Soul
the Truth is Out There
Believe There is Good in The World
Please Wipe Your Feet
Seat Belts Must Be Worn In This Vehicle
That Wasn't Very Cash Money of You
Either Pass Or Get Off My Ass
You Shut Your Mouth When You're Talking to Me
Prevent Accidents Keep Your Mouth Shut
I Love The Sound You Make When You Shut Up
Shut Up! I Fucking Got This
I won't be remembered as a Woman who kept her mouth shut
Keep Right Except to Pass
d Right Pass Left
Go Around me I Left on time
Go Ahead and Pass Me I'll See You At The Next Light
You Just Got Passed by A Girl
