I Don't Stop When I'm Tired When I'm Done
The ONLY Easy Day was Yesterday
I'm Retired Do It Yourself!
I'm Not Retired I'm A Professional Grandma
Retired! Not My Problem Anymore
I'd Rather Be Fishing
I Like Big Bass and I Cannot Lie
It's Not How Deep You Fish, It's How Much You Wiggle Your Worm
I Just Hold My Rod Wiggle My Worm And Bam She's On It
Education is Important But Fishing is Importanter
Dont Let The Fishing Gear Fool You, I'm Broke
How Can I Miss You If You Dont Go Away
I Still Remember The Days I Prayed for The Things I Have Now
Honk If You Love Goth Girls
Honk if you love Jesus
I Knit So I Don't Kill People
I ONLY Fish ON Days That END with Y
I Don't Break for Zombies
In God we Trust
The Bravest Hero I Ever Knew Now Watches Over ME
I was Hoping for a Battle of wits, but You Appear to be Unarmed
Warning! I Pound Everything
I GO Where Iâ€™M Towed
Do Something Today That Your Future Self Will Thank You for
Give it to God and Go to Sleep...
for I Know The Plans I Have for You
for This Child I Prayed and The Lord Answered My Prayers
Exercise, I Thought You Said 'Extra Fries'
I Jerk it Every Chance I get
I'm Literally Just A Girl 
I'm not short. I'm just more down to earth than most people
I Just Want to Drink Wine and Rescue Dogs
in Dog Beers I've Only Had One
the House was Clean Yesterday Sorry You Missed IT!
I Feel Like i'm Already Tired Tomorrow
