Those WHO Trade Freedom for Safety Deserve Neither
Those Who Disrespect Our Flag Have Never Been Handed A Folded One
I Prefer Dangerous Freedom Over Peaceful Slavery
Those Who Ignore History are Condemned to Repeat it
It is Easier to Build Strong Children Than to Repair Broken Men
I Don't Have Enough Time Or Crayons to Explain This to You
There Comes Time When Silence is Betrayal
Curse Your Sudden But Inevitable Betrayal 
When Government Fears The People, There is Liberty
When the people fear the government, there is tyranny
Hate Has No Place Here
All Our Dreams Can Come True, If We Have The Courage to Pursue Them
Dissent is The Highest Form of Patriotism
The Greatest Danger to American Freedom is A Government That Ignores The Constitution
When Tyranny Becomes Law, Rebellion Becomes Duty
When Injustice Becomes Law Resistance Becomes Duty
Beware for I am fearless and therefore powerful
Be Strong, Be Brave, Be Fearless, Never Alone
Be Fearless In The Pursuit Of What Sets Your Soul On Fire
It's Dangerous That's Why I Like It
RIDE IT LIKE YOU STOLE IT!
Drive IT LIKE YOU STOLE IT !
Think! It's Not Illegal Yet
I Prefer Dangerous Liberty to Peaceful Servitude
I May Not Go Down in History But I Will Go Down On Your Sister
The Time is Always Right to Do What's Right
Do What is Right Not What is Easy
All Gave Some Some Gave All
will TRADE RACISTS FOR REFUGEES
We are All Immigrants 
Make Yourself A Sheep and the Wolves Will Eat You
Those Who Act Like Sheep Will Be Eaten by Wolves
Throw Me to The Wolves and I Will Return Leading The Pack
The Wolf Doesn't Lose Sleep Over the Opinions of Sheep
The only Thing we Have to Fear is Fear Itself
Oh Crap That's Due Tomorrow?
Impossible to Govern Without God and The Bible
Love All, Trust A Few, Do Wrong to None
