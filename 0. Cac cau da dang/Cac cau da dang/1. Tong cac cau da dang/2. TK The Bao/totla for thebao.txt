I Love The Sound You Make When You Shut Up
Shut Up! I Fucking Got This
I won't be remembered as a Woman who kept her mouth shut

I Cry A Lot But I Am So Productive
Please Let Me Merge Before I Start Crying

I'm Not Retired I'm A Professional Grandma
Retired! Not My Problem Anymore
I'd Rather Be Fishing
I Like Big Bass and I Cannot Lie
It's Not How Deep You Fish, It's How Much You Wiggle Your Worm
I Just Hold My Rod Wiggle My Worm And Bam She's On It
Education is Important But Fishing is Importanter
Dont Let The Fishing Gear Fool You, I'm Broke
How Can I Miss You If You Dont Go Away
I Still Remember The Days I Prayed for The Things I Have Now
Honk If You Love Goth Girls
Honk if you love Jesus
I Knit So I Don't Kill People
I ONLY Fish ON Days That END with Y
I Don't Break for Zombies
In God we Trust
The Bravest Hero I Ever Knew Now Watches Over ME

American Or Democrat
are You American or Democrat
Just Another Republican Working Hard So You Don't Have To
Proud to Be Everything A Republican Hates
Proud to Be A Republican
Proud to BE Everything A Liberal Hates
Republican Because not Everyone can be on Welfare
Evil is Powerless If The Good are Unafraid
Government is Not The Solution Government is The Problem
A Nation That Cannot Control Its Borders is Not A Nation
The American Dream is NOT a Handout
Goverment's First Duty is to Protect The People not Run Their Lives
i believe The Best Social Program is a Job
The Problem with Jokes is They Get Elected
The Problem with Political Jokes is They Get Elected
Work Hard Millions on Welfare Depend You
Don't Blame Me, I Voted Republican
Those WHO Trade Freedom for Safety Deserve Neither
Those Who Disrespect Our Flag Have Never Been Handed A Folded One
I Prefer Dangerous Freedom Over Peaceful Slavery
Those Who Ignore History are Condemned to Repeat it
It is Easier to Build Strong Children Than to Repair Broken Men
I Don't Have Enough Time Or Crayons to Explain This to You
There Comes Time When Silence is Betrayal
Curse Your Sudden But Inevitable Betrayal
When Government Fears The People, There is Liberty
When the people fear the government, there is tyranny
Hate Has No Place Here
All Our Dreams Can Come True, If We Have The Courage to Pursue Them
Dissent is The Highest Form of Patriotism
When Tyranny Becomes Law, Rebellion Becomes Duty
When Injustice Becomes Law Resistance Becomes Duty
Beware for I am fearless and therefore powerful
Be Strong, Be Brave, Be Fearless, Never Alone
Be Fearless In The Pursuit Of What Sets Your Soul On Fire
It's Dangerous That's Why I Like It
RIDE IT LIKE YOU STOLE IT!
Drive IT LIKE YOU STOLE IT !
Think! It's Not Illegal Yet
I Prefer Dangerous Liberty to Peaceful Servitude
I May Not Go Down in History But I Will Go Down On Your Sister
The Time is Always Right to Do What's Right
All Gave Some Some Gave All
will TRADE RACISTS FOR REFUGEES
We are All Immigrants
Make Yourself A Sheep and the Wolves Will Eat You
Those Who Act Like Sheep Will Be Eaten by Wolves
Throw Me to The Wolves and I Will Return Leading The Pack
The Wolf Doesn't Lose Sleep Over the Opinions of Sheep
The only Thing we Have to Fear is Fear Itself
Oh Crap That's Due Tomorrow?
Impossible to Govern Without God and The Bible
Love All, Trust A Few, Do Wrong to None
